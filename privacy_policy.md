# Privacy Policy for Kindle Library Chrome Extension

*Last Updated: April 12, 2025*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Kindle Library Chrome Extension ("we," "our," or "the extension") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our browser extension. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

## Information We Collect

The Kindle Library Chrome Extension collects the following information:

1. **Book Data**: The extension scrapes book information from your Kindle Library on the Amazon website (read.amazon.com), including book titles, authors, ASINs, and whether items are samples.

2. **Enhanced Book Data**: When you choose to use the "Search Goodreads" feature, the extension searches Goodreads.com for additional information about your books, including genres, ratings, publication dates, and book descriptions.

## How We Use Your Information

All data collected by the extension is:
- Stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API
- Never transmitted to our servers
- Only sent to Goodreads.com when you explicitly request additional information about your books

The extension uses this information solely to:
- Display statistics about your book collection
- Allow searching and filtering of your library
- Generate visualizations of your reading habits

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

The Kindle Library Chrome Extension:
- Does not share your data with any third parties
- Does not use your data for advertising purposes
- Does not track your browsing history or activities outside of the Amazon Kindle Library page

The only external service contacted is Goodreads.com, and this occurs only when you explicitly use the "Search Goodreads" feature to enhance your book data.

## Data Storage

All data collected by the extension is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. You can download this data as JSON files for backup purposes. Data is not synchronized across devices unless you manually transfer these JSON files.

## Your Rights and Choices

You have full control over your data:
- You can delete all stored data by clearing Chrome's extension storage
- You can choose not to use the Goodreads search feature
- You can uninstall the extension at any time, which will remove all stored data

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date and will be available in the extension's GitHub repository and Chrome Web Store listing.
